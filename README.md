# Implementing Scanner & Parser for CSML

The parser has implemented by using bison and the scanner has implemented by using flex for an XML-based language which is called CSML, standing for Course Schedule Markup Language. The language is used to give the timetable for courses scheduled at our university.

This project has been implemented for an undergraduate course CS305 - Programming Languages at Sabanci University
